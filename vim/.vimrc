" Description
" -----------
"
" This is my Vim config file.  It should be distributed together with my
" '.vim' directory.  I try to keep the entire setup simple.  I use no
" plugins whatsoever, have no custom key bindings, while I do not
" leverage ANY of the multiplexing and session-management features of
" vim: that is the job of tmux, the window manager, or whatever
" dedicated tool.  For me, Vim is just a text editor.
"
" This is part of my dotfiles, which deploy a custom desktop session
" based on BSPWM: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles.
"
" The colour scheme is part of my Tempus Themes (designed for
" accessibility): https://protesilaos.com/tempus-themes.  Theme files
" are bundled with my dots (Tempus themes are fully integrated into my
" dotfiles and are applied almost everywhere).
"
" I run Vim exclusively in the console, but also install a graphical
" version as a fallback option.  On Debian 'buster':
"
"	sudo apt install vim vim-gtk3
