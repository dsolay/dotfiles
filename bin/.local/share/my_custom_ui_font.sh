# I use a custom font with my `dmenu` interfaces.  The current file
# defines as much.  This file is sourced from some of my scripts at
# $HOME/bin.  The idea is to define the custom font once.  This script is
# part of my dotfiles and is meant to work in that environment.  See
# https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles

# For the actual font family, see the rules inside the "fontconfig"
# directory of my dotfiles.
#
# Desirable values for the font family are the generic `fontconfig`
# aliases: sans, serif, monospace OR the name of the typeface.  The font
# weight can only be one that is supported by the designated font.
