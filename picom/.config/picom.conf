# ~/.config/compton.conf
#

# Description
# ===========
#
# This is the `compton` configuration file.  Compton is the display
# compositor used in my custom working environment, centred around
# `bspwm`.  See my dotfiles https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles.
#
# To install on Debian, run:
#   sudo apt install compton
#
# See `man compton` on the origin of all technical comments and the
# available options.  Note that multiple options are contingent on
# various pieces of hardware and/or their drivers.  These are known to
# affect performance.  What is included herein has been tested on a
# Lenovo ThinkPad X220 running an up-to-date version of Debian
# Buster/Sid.
#
# Last reviewed on: 2018-11-12

# Backend
# =======

# This is hardware dependent.  On my Lenovo ThinkPad X220, all options
# work.  However, the "xr_glx_hybrid" value seems to be the most
# portable.
backend="glx"; # (xrender|glx|xr_glx_hybrid)

# Xrender backend
# --------------
# Use X Sync fence to sync clients' draw calls. Needed on nvidia-drivers with GLX backend for some users.
xrender-sync-fence=false;

# GLX backend
# -----------
glx-no-stencil=true;
glx-copy-from-front=false;
# glx-use-copysubbuffermesa = false; # overrides `glx-copy-from-front`
glx-no-rebind-pixmap=true; # recommended as "true" if it works with the video driver
# glx-swap-method has been deprecated since v6
# glx-swap-method="undefined"; # slowest, but safest
# glx-use-gpushader4=false;

# Shadows
# =======

shadow=true;
shadow-radius=3; # default 12
shadow-offset-x=-3; # left offset, default -15
shadow-offset-y=-3; # top offset, default -15
shadow-opacity=0.8; # default 0.75

shadow-red=0.2 # default 0 = black (1.0 = white)
shadow-green=0.2 # default 0 = black (1.0 = white)
shadow-blue=0.2 # default 0 = black (1.0 = white)

# "clear-shadow" is removed as an option, and is always enabled now. Consider removing it from your config file
# clear-shadow=true; # may not work with fully transparent ARGB
shadow-ignore-shaped=true;

# The shadow exclude options are helpful if you have shadows enabled.
# Due to the way compton draws its shadows, certain applications will
# have visual glitches (most applications are fine, only apps that do
# weird things with xshapes or argb are affected).  This list includes
# all the affected apps I found in my testing. The "! name~=''" part
# excludes shadows on any "Unknown" windows, this prevents a visual
# glitch with the XFWM alt tab switcher.

# actual value.
